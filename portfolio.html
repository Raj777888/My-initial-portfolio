        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Raj Bhusal</strong>, a learner and aspiring creative currently diving into the world
          of
          digital design. I’m passionate about turning ideas into visuals, especially through Photoshop, which I’m
          studying as part of my computer class.</p>
        <p>I believe that great design tells a story, and I'm focused on building those stories — one edit, one
          layout
          at a time. I often get inspired by my friend Roney, a Photoshop expert who handles his work with precision
          and
          professionalism.</p>
        <p>Outside of learning, I value deep connections, honesty, and expressing myself both visually and
          emotionally.
          Whether it's through design or words, I always try to bring something real to the table.</p>
